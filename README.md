Cube Sat Comm (CSC)
===================

### What is it?
Cube Sat Comm is a general purpose ground station implementation for cube sats developed by Alberta Sat, a multi-disciplinary team of students from the University of Alberta dedicated to designing and building cube sats. Ex-Alta 1, Alberta Sat's first launched satellite, relied on proprietary ground station software. Since one of the goals of Alberta Sat is to provide a base framework for other cube sat teams to use, relying on proprietary software is a problem. From this, it was decided that it was worth looking into developing an open source ground station implementation which is flexible enough to be used by other teams. The design of CSC has the general cube sat in mind, not just Ex-Alta 2, Alberta Sat's second satellite currently in production.

### Current Status
Currently development is in the very early stages and the project is not yet functional. As the project becomes functional documentation will be added.
